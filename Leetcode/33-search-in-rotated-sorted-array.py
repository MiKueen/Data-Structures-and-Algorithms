Problem Statement : Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
'''

class Solution:
	# Should have used binary search as the array is sorted, will be updating the code soon1
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == target:
                return i
        return -1
